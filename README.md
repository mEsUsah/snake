# Snake clone, HTML5 game #
Clone based on the youtube video tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Azlj0f9vas.

This was my very second game written from scratch.
I followed the youtube video, and rewrote the game, made it object oriented and added a lot of functionality, including touch controls and simple fullscreen capabileties.
The game can be played on my homepage [haxor.no](https://www.haxor.no/portfolio/snake).

Game has three difficulty levels, and two game modes.

## Game Modes ##
In normal gamemode the game ends if the snake bites its tail or crashes into the walls.

In "4D" gamemode the snake will appear to come out of the opposing wall when it normally would crash into it.

## Difficulty levels ##
Easy, slow speed and just on e and one apple at a time. Speed will increase by 1 increment after 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 points. One apple = 1 point.

Normal, normal speed and two apples at a time. Speed will increase by 1.5 increments after 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 points. One apple = 2 points.

Hard, high speed and three apples at a time. Speed will increase by 1.5 increments after 15, 30, 60, 120, 320 and 480 points. One apple = 3 points.

## Special feature - reflex saver ##
Just like in the original on 90's Nokia phones, there is a feature that makes the player able - for one animation frame -  to save them selves if the snake is about to die from eating its tail or hitting the wall.
